<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="dropcap">W</span>ITH farmer Allan at the farm abode<br>
<span class="i0">William and Dora. William was his son,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And she his niece. He often look'd at them,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And often thought, 'I'll make them man and</span><br>
<span class="i4">wife.'</span><br>
<span class="i0">Now Dora felt her uncle's will in all,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And yearn'd towards William; but the youth,</span><br>
<span class="i4">because</span><br>
<span class="i0">He had been always with her in the house,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thought not of Dora.</span><br>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">Then there came a day</span><br>
<span class="i0">When Allan call'd his son, and said, 'My son:</span><br>
<span class="i0">I married late, but I would wish to see</span><br>
<span class="i0">My grandchild on my knees before I die:</span><br>
<span class="i0">And I have set my heart upon a match.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Now therefore look to Dora; she is well</span><br>
<span class="i0">To look to; thrifty too beyond her age.</span><br>
<span class="i0">She is my brother's daughter; he and I</span><br>
<span class="i0">Had once hard words, and parted, and he died</span><br>
<span class="i0">In foreign lands; but for his sake I bred</span><br>
<span class="i0">His daughter Dora: take her for your wife;</span><br>
<span class="i0">For I have wish'd this marriage, night and day,</span><br>
<span class="i0">For many years.' But William answer'd short;</span><br>
<span class="i0">'I cannot marry Dora; by my life,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I will not marry Dora.' Then the old man</span><br>
<span class="i0">Was wroth, and doubled up his hands, and said:</span><br>
<span class="i0">'You will not, boy! you dare to answer thus!</span><br>
<span class="i0">But in my time a father's word was law,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And so it shall be now for me. Look to it;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Consider, William: take a month to think,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And let me have an answer to my wish;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or, by the Lord that made me, you shall pack,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And never more darken my doors again.'</span>
</div></div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But William answer'd madly; bit his lips,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And broke away. The more he look'd at her</span><br>
<span class="i0">The less he liked her; and his ways were harsh;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But Dora bore them meekly. Then before</span><br>
<span class="i0">The month was out he left his father's house,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And hired himself to work within the fields;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And half in love, half spite, he woo'd and wed</span><br>
<span class="i0">A laborer's daughter, Mary Morrison.</span>

<span class="i2">Then, when the bells were ringing, Allan call'd</span><br>
<span class="i0">His niece and said: 'My girl, I love you well;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But if you speak with him that was my son,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or change a word with her he calls his wife,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My home is none of yours. My will is law,'</span><br>
<span class="i0">And Dora promised, being meek. She thought,</span><br>
<span class="i0">'It cannot be: my uncle's mind will change!'</span>
</div></div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And days went on, and there was born a boy</span><br>
<span class="i0">To William; then distresses came on him;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And day by day he pass'd his father's gate,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Heart-broken, and his father help'd him not.</span><br>
<span class="i0">But Dora stored what little she could save,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And sent it them by stealth, nor did they know</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who sent it; till at last a fever seized</span><br>
<span class="i0">On William, and in harvest time he died.</span><br>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then Dora went to Mary. Mary sat</span><br>
<span class="i0">And look'd with tears upon her boy, and thought</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hard things of Dora. Dora came and said:</span><br>
<span class="i2">'I have obey'd my uncle until now,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And I have sinn'd, for it was all thro' me</span><br>
<span class="i0">This evil came on William at the first.</span>

<span class="i0">But, Mary, for the sake of him that's gone,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And for your sake, the woman that he chose,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And for this orphan, I am come to you:</span><br>
<span class="i0">You know there has not been for these five years</span><br>
<span class="i0">So full a harvest: let me take the boy,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And I will set him in my uncle's eye</span><br>
<span class="i0">Among the wheat; that when his heart is glad</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of the full harvest, he may see the boy,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And bless him for the sake of him that's gone.'</span><br>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And Dora took the child, and went her way</span><br>
<span class="i0">Across the wheat, and sat upon a mound</span><br>
<span class="i0">That was unsown, where many poppies grew.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Far off the farmer came into the field</span><br>
<span class="i0">And spied her not; for none of all his men</span><br>
<span class="i0">Dare tell him Dora waited with the child;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And Dora would have risen and gone to him,</span><br>
<span class="i0">But her heart fail'd her; and the reapers reap'd,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And the sun fell, and all the land was dark.</span>

<span class="i2">But when the morrow came she rose and took</span><br>
<span class="i0">The child once more, and sat upon the mound;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And made a little wreath of all the flowers</span><br>
<span class="i0">That grew about, and tied it round his hat,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To make him pleasing in her uncle's eye.</span>

<span class="i0">Then when the farmer pass'd into the field</span><br>
<span class="i0">He spied her, and he left his men at work,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And came and said: 'Where were you yesterday?</span><br>
<span class="i0">Whose child is that? What are you doing here?'</span><br>
<span class="i0">So Dora cast her eyes upon the ground,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And answer'd softly, 'This is William's child!'&mdash;</span><br>
<span class="i0">'And did I not,' said Allan, 'did I not</span><br>
<span class="i0">Forbid you, Dora?' Dora said again:</span><br>
<span class="i0">'Do with me as you will, but take the child,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And bless him for the sake of him that's gone!'</span>

<span class="i0">I must be taught my duty, and by you!</span><br>
<span class="i0">You knew my word was law, and yet you dared</span><br>
<span class="i0">To slight it. Well&mdash;for I will take the boy;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But go you hence, and never see me more.'</span>

<span class="i2">So saying, he took the boy, that cried aloud</span><br>
<span class="i0">And struggled hard. The wreath of flowers fell</span><br>
<span class="i0">At Dora's feet. She bow'd upon her hands,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And the boy's cry came to her from the field,</span><br>
<span class="i0">More and more distant.</span><br>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">She bow'd down her head,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Remembering the day when first she came,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And all the things that had been.</span>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then Dora went to Mary's house, and stood</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon the threshold. Mary saw the boy</span><br>
<span class="i0">Was not with Dora. She broke out in praise</span><br>
<span class="i0">To God, that help'd her in her widowhood.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And Dora said, 'My uncle took the boy;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But, Mary, let me live and work with you:</span><br>
<span class="i0">He says that he will never see me more.'</span><br>
<span class="i0">Then answer'd Mary, 'This shall never be,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That thou shouldst take my trouble on thyself:</span><br>
<span class="i0">And, now I think, he shall not have the boy,</span><br>
<span class="i0">For he will teach him hardness, and to slight</span><br>
<span class="i0">His mother; therefore thou and I will go,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And I will have my boy, and bring him home;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And I will beg of him to take thee back;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But if he will not take thee back again,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Then thou and I will live within one house,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And work for William's child, until he grows</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of age to help us.'</span><br>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">So the women kiss'd</span><br>
<span class="i0">Each other, and set out, and reach'd the farm.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The door was off the latch: they peep'd and saw</span><br>
<span class="i0">The boy set up betwixt his grandsire's knees,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who thrust him in the hollows of his arm,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And clapt him on the hands and on the cheeks,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Like one that loved him: and the lad stretch'd</span><br>
<span class="i4">out</span><br>
<span class="i0">And babbled for the golden seal, that hung</span><br>
<span class="i0">From Allan's watch, and sparkled by the fire.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Then they came in: but when the boy beheld</span><br>
<span class="i0">His mother, he cried out to come to her:</span><br>
<span class="i0">And Allan set him down, and Mary said:</span>

<span class="i0">He could not ever rue his marrying me&mdash;</span><br>
<span class="i0">I had been a patient wife: but, Sir, he said</span><br>
<span class="i0">That he was wrong to cross his father thus:</span><br>
<span class="i0">"God bless him!" he said, "and may he never</span><br>
<span class="i4">know</span><br>

<span class="i0">Will make him hard, and he will learn to slight</span><br>
<span class="i0">His father's memory; and take Dora back,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And let all this be as it was before.'</span><br>
<span class="i2">So Mary said, and Dora hid her face</span><br>
<span class="i0">By Mary. There was silence in the room;</span><br>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And all at once the old man burst in sobs;</span><br>

<span class="i0">I have kill'd him&mdash;but I loved him&mdash;my dear</span><br>

<span class="i0">May God forgive me!&mdash;I have been to blame.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Kiss me, my children.'</span><br>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">Then they clung about</span><br>
<span class="i0">The old man's neck, and kiss'd him many times,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And all the man was broken with remorse;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And all his love came back a hundred fold;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And for three hours he sobb'd o'er William's</span><br>
