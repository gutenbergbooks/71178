<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="dropcap">W</span>ITH farmer Allan at the farm abode<br>
<span class="i0">William and Dora. William was his son,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And she his niece. He often look'd at them,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And often thought, 'I'll make them man and</span><br>
<span class="i4">wife.'</span><br>
<span class="i0">Now Dora felt her uncle's will in all,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And yearn'd towards William; but the youth,</span><br>
<span class="i4">because</span><br>
<span class="i0">He had been always with her in the house,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Thought not of Dora.</span><br>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">Then there came a day</span><br>
<span class="i0">When Allan call'd his son, and said, 'My son:</span><br>
<span class="i0">I married late, but I would wish to see</span><br>
<span class="i0">My grandchild on my knees before I die:</span><br>
<span class="i0">And I have set my heart upon a match.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Now therefore look to Dora; she is well</span><br>
<span class="i0">To look to; thrifty too beyond her age.</span><br>
<span class="i0">She is my brother's daughter; he and I</span><br>
<span class="i0">Had once hard words, and parted, and he died</span><br>
<span class="i0">In foreign lands; but for his sake I bred</span><br>
<span class="i0">His daughter Dora: take her for your wife;</span><br>
<span class="i0">For I have wish'd this marriage, night and day,</span><br>
<span class="i0">For many years.' But William answer'd short;</span><br>
<span class="i0">'I cannot marry Dora; by my life,</span><br>
<span class="i0">I will not marry Dora.' Then the old man</span><br>
<span class="i0">Was wroth, and doubled up his hands, and said:</span><br>
<span class="i0">'You will not, boy! you dare to answer thus!</span><br>
<span class="i0">But in my time a father's word was law,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And so it shall be now for me. Look to it;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Consider, William: take a month to think,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And let me have an answer to my wish;</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or, by the Lord that made me, you shall pack,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And never more darken my doors again.'</span>
</div></div></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But William answer'd madly; bit his lips,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And broke away. The more he look'd at her</span><br>
<span class="i0">The less he liked her; and his ways were harsh;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But Dora bore them meekly. Then before</span><br>
<span class="i0">The month was out he left his father's house,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And hired himself to work within the fields;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And half in love, half spite, he woo'd and wed</span><br>
<span class="i0">A laborer's daughter, Mary Morrison.</span>
</div></div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then, when the bells were ringing, Allan call'd</span><br>
<span class="i0">His niece and said: 'My girl, I love you well;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But if you speak with him that was my son,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Or change a word with her he calls his wife,</span><br>
<span class="i0">My home is none of yours. My will is law,'</span><br>
<span class="i0">And Dora promised, being meek. She thought,</span><br>
<span class="i0">'It cannot be: my uncle's mind will change!'</span>
</div></div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And days went on, and there was born a boy</span><br>
<span class="i0">To William; then distresses came on him;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And day by day he pass'd his father's gate,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Heart-broken, and his father help'd him not.</span><br>
<span class="i0">But Dora stored what little she could save,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And sent it them by stealth, nor did they know</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who sent it; till at last a fever seized</span><br>
<span class="i0">On William, and in harvest time he died.</span><br>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then Dora went to Mary. Mary sat</span><br>
<span class="i0">And look'd with tears upon her boy, and thought</span><br>
<span class="i0">Hard things of Dora. Dora came and said:</span><br>
<span class="i2">'I have obey'd my uncle until now,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And I have sinn'd, for it was all thro' me</span><br>
<span class="i0">This evil came on William at the first.</span>

<span class="i0">But, Mary, for the sake of him that's gone,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And for your sake, the woman that he chose,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And for this orphan, I am come to you:</span><br>
<span class="i0">You know there has not been for these five years</span><br>
<span class="i0">So full a harvest: let me take the boy,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And I will set him in my uncle's eye</span><br>
<span class="i0">Among the wheat; that when his heart is glad</span><br>
<span class="i0">Of the full harvest, he may see the boy,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And bless him for the sake of him that's gone.'</span><br>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And Dora took the child, and went her way</span><br>
<span class="i0">Across the wheat, and sat upon a mound</span><br>
<span class="i0">That was unsown, where many poppies grew.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Far off the farmer came into the field</span><br>
<span class="i0">And spied her not; for none of all his men</span><br>
<span class="i0">Dare tell him Dora waited with the child;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And Dora would have risen and gone to him,</span><br>
<span class="i0">But her heart fail'd her; and the reapers reap'd,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And the sun fell, and all the land was dark.</span>

<span class="i0">That grew about, and tied it round his hat,</span><br>
<span class="i0">To make him pleasing in her uncle's eye.</span>

<span class="i0">Whose child is that? What are you doing here?'</span><br>
<span class="i0">So Dora cast her eyes upon the ground,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And answer'd softly, 'This is William's child!'&mdash;</span><br>
<span class="i0">'And did I not,' said Allan, 'did I not</span><br>

<span class="i2">Then Dora went to Mary's house, and stood</span><br>
<span class="i0">Upon the threshold. Mary saw the boy</span><br>
<span class="i0">Was not with Dora. She broke out in praise</span><br>
<span class="i0">To God, that help'd her in her widowhood.</span><br>
<span class="i0">And Dora said, 'My uncle took the boy;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But, Mary, let me live and work with you:</span><br>
<span class="i0">He says that he will never see me more.'</span><br>
<span class="i0">Then answer'd Mary, 'This shall never be,</span><br>
<span class="i0">That thou shouldst take my trouble on thyself:</span><br>
<span class="i0">And, now I think, he shall not have the boy,</span><br>
<span class="i0">For he will teach him hardness, and to slight</span><br>
<span class="i0">His mother; therefore thou and I will go,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And I will have my boy, and bring him home;</span><br>
<span class="i0">And I will beg of him to take thee back;</span><br>
<span class="i0">But if he will not take thee back again,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Then thou and I will live within one house,</span><br>

<span class="i20">So the women kiss'd</span><br>
<span class="i0">Each other, and set out, and reach'd the farm.</span><br>
<span class="i0">The door was off the latch: they peep'd and saw</span><br>
<span class="i0">The boy set up betwixt his grandsire's knees,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Who thrust him in the hollows of his arm,</span><br>
<span class="i0">And clapt him on the hands and on the cheeks,</span><br>
<span class="i0">Like one that loved him: and the lad stretch'd</span><br>
<span class="i4">out</span><br>
<span class="i0">And babbled for the golden seal, that hung</span><br>
<span class="i0">From Allan's watch, and sparkled by the fire.</span><br>
<span class="i0">Then they came in: but when the boy beheld</span><br>
<span class="i0">His mother, he cried out to come to her:</span><br>

<span class="i0">I had been a patient wife: but, Sir, he said</span><br>

<span class="i0">And let all this be as it was before.'</span><br>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
